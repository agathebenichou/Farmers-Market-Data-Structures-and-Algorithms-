PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To apply and expand our computer science knowledge
VERSION or DATE: Version 1 / 10-13-2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: All instructions are in user instructions.
AUTHORS: Agathe Benichou
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

	HELLO USER OF MY PROJECT!!! ( aka Professor Liew)

1 - To view this project, please open the BlueJ package.

***Sometimes the BlueJ classes do not show once you open the
package. In order for them to show in the package (with the
box diagrams), you have to go through the PROJECT1 folder and
open all the JAVA Files, even the test ones.
Once all the JAVA files are opened (there will be alot of files 
open on your computer), RE OPEN the package. 
Now you will see the class/unit test diagram.


2- Once the package is open and all the classes are displayed,
run the ExperimentController class.

3- You can run the experiment controller class by right
clicking on the box called ExperimentController and clicking on
the "new ExperimentController()" and pressing enter.

4- This will run the simulation and the terminal window will
 open. I have alot of print lines throughout my project and 
the terminal will display the result of all those print lines.
Scroll up to the first print line on the terminal to view my 
project. It might take a little time, about two minutes,
for the terminal window to finish running.

Thank you!
