PROJECT TITLE: CS150 Project 3 	
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Building off of Projects 1 and 2, the purpose of Project 3 is to find the Shortest Tour for a vendor deliviering their goods to all customers who have that good on their list in different cities.
A Graph was used to create the cities and paths the vendor has to deliver to with a city being a vertex (or node) and the distance to that city from another city being the edge. The cities and distances are read from a 
citymap.txt file which was generated by the Professor. Each good has a price per unit which is read from a goods.txt file generated by the Professor. The warehouse locations of all the vendors is read from a locations.txt
file also generated by the Professor. Using these three .txt files, the classes and data structures created from our Projects 2 and our knowledge of graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm, we have to generate a shortest tour
for all vendors.
within the cities. 
VERSION or DATE: Version 1 - 12/10/2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Agathe Benichou
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1- With the provided .java files, run the InputMethods.java file.
2- A tab will open and there will be an option for "void main(String[] args)", click on that. 
3- Within the {} brackets, put a cost per distance unit in quotations. The cost per distance unit should be 
a double such as 1.00, 3.42 or 5.12. It should look like {"1.24"}.
4- After you press okay the program will run and there will be many printed lines.
5-
The graph of cities is the Graph that contains all the cities which comes from the citymap.txt container, the
profit container is the container that has each good and the profit the vendor will make from selling one unit
of that good, this information comes from the goods.txt file. The warehouse container is where the cities are 
stored that contain warehouses for each good. Some goods have more warehouses than other and that information
comes from the locations.txt file. After the files have been read, the data structures that use that information
to fill up will be created and filled by generating customers. The Item City Container has all the goods and
for each good, a list of cities which have at least one customer who has that good on their list. The City Customer
Container has all the cities and for each city, a list of customers in that city. 

After all the containers have been filled and printed, the shortest tour simulation will run.
For each good..
The shortest tour from the warehouse to all the cities with customers who have that good on their list and back to 
the warehouse will print out. Each number is a city. 
Then the total amount made delivering, the total cost and the overall profit will be calculated and printed
